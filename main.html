    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        <b>Time complexity</b> refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. 
        It helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is when handling large inputs and allows us to compare different approaches for solving the same problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run completely. 
        It includes both auxiliary space and the space used by input data. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the input size.
